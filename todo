Validate "New test result" for exhaustive list of setup's component versions
add "type" to test result?
with arbitrary string, e.g. "e2e UI", "manual" etc

editing fields

CI
add version
add test result

Manual
add component
add version
add setup
add test result

CHALLENGES
lots of components ( > 10 updated on frequent basis)

    hard to keep track of
        - existing versions
        - compatibility/breaking changes
        - existing deployment variations

    no automated tests -> hard to check what is broken -> troubleshooting is a pain (what/where is broken)

SOLUTIONS?
manual tracking with xlsx spreadsheet

CONS: - prone to human error (easy to forget, make mistakes) - VBA automation - does not work in web -> hard to share/collaborate

WHAT WE'RE AIMING FOR
e2e automated smoke for basic setups
single java agent
microservice java agent
js agent
...etc

    automated tracking of
        existing set of components
        latest versions
        various setups
        various test results
            e2e auto tests
            manual tests
        who authored changes

IMPLEMENTATION
Use GitHub repository as a storage. Why?
no hosting required
publicly available
built-in history & authentication

    Implement lightweight wrapper to CRUD components/versions/tests/setups

    Human-friendly web panel
        Quick dashboard for current versions status
        Manual testing status update
            UI hosted on Github Pages
            _almost_ no backend required (sans GitHub OAuth proxy)

    Integrate with our CI/CD
        "perfect world"
        check each setup if dependant component changed
        record results

PROS:
info on versions is centralized, publicly available and auto-updated

    expandable ->
        utilize versions data to implement .sh scripts to ease deployment
        ("one-click" deployment of various setups (where it's possible/reasonable))
            Q: Why?
            A: Questions like "exact components to deploy"/"exact versions to utilize" are common hiccup among new users
